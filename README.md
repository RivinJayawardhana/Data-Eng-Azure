# End-to-End Data Engineering Project on Azure

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline built using **Microsoft Azure** services and **dbt (Data Build Tool)** for efficient data transformation and orchestration.

## 🚀 Overview

![Azure Data Engineering Architecture](./images/azure_data_pipeline_architecture.png)

The pipeline covers the full data lifecycle — from ingestion and storage to transformation and analytics — using a modern, cloud-native stack. It integrates multiple Azure components to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

### ☁️ Azure (Cloud Provider)
Azure serves as the foundation of this project, offering a secure, scalable, and fully managed environment for all data operations.

### 🗄️ Azure SQL Database
Used as the primary relational database system. The **AdventureWorks LT** sample database is employed to demonstrate data ingestion, transformation, and analysis workflows.

### 📂 Azure Data Lake
Acts as the central storage layer for raw, intermediate, and processed data. It supports large-scale data storage in multiple formats, enabling analytics and reporting.

### 🔐 Azure Key Vault
Manages sensitive credentials, keys, and secrets securely, ensuring compliance and preventing unauthorized access to data resources.

### ⚙️ Azure Databricks
An Apache Spark–based analytics platform for large-scale data processing and transformation. Used to clean, process, and prepare data for downstream analytics.

### 🔄 Azure Data Factory
Orchestrates and automates the movement and transformation of data between services. It serves as the primary data pipeline tool for integrating various components.

### 🧱 dbt (Data Build Tool)
Handles SQL-based transformations, testing, and documentation. dbt ensures consistent, version-controlled data modeling and enhances data reliability within the Azure ecosystem.
